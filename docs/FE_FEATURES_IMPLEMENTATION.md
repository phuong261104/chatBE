# FE Feature Implementation Notes

Updated: 2026-06-01

This document summarizes what the backend already provides and what the frontend needs to implement for:
- Typing indicator for messages
- Online status (green dot)
- Device login management (auth profile)
- Friend management
- Delete conversation

- Socket reference: docs/SOCKET_IO_BACKEND_REFERENCE.md

## 1) Typing indicator

### BE provides

Socket namespace:
- /messages (business typing events)

Client -> Server:
- typing:start
- typing:stop

Payload:
- Private typing: { toUserId }
- Group typing: { groupId }

Server -> Client:
- typing:start with { userId, toUserId? } or { userId, groupId }
- typing:stop with { userId, toUserId? } or { userId, groupId }

Notes:
- Root namespace typing only touches presence; do not use it for chat UI.
- /messages socket is auth-protected and already joins user rooms.

### FE needs to do

- Connect to /messages socket with JWT auth.
- When user starts typing, emit typing:start with toUserId (private) or groupId (group).
- Debounce typing:start (e.g., send once, then keepalive every 3-5s if still typing).
- On idle (e.g., 2-3s no keystroke), emit typing:stop.
- Listen for typing:start/typing:stop and show typing UI only within the active conversation.

### UI suggestion

- Private chat: show "User is typing..." under header or above input.
- Group chat: show compact "A, B are typing" with max 2 names and a +N suffix.

## 2) Online status (green dot)

### BE provides

Root namespace:
- user:online
- user:offline
- getOnlineStatus (ack)
- getBatchOnlineStatus (ack)

Payload includes:
- online / isOnline
- lastSeen
- visibility (privacy-aware)

REST:
- GET /v1/users/{id}/presence (privacy-aware)

Notes:
- Presence is filtered by privacy and relationship.
- /messages also re-emits user:online/user:offline, but root is the canonical presence helper.

### FE needs to do

- On app start, connect to root namespace and to /messages.
- For visible user lists (chat list, friend list, profile card), call getBatchOnlineStatus with userIds.
- Subscribe to user:online and user:offline to update dots in real time.
- Honor privacy: if response says not visible, show "last seen hidden" or no dot.

### UI suggestion

- Green dot for online, gray dot for offline if allowed, or hide if privacy says hidden.
- For lists, use subtle dot overlay on avatar; for profile page, use label + dot.

## 3) Device login management (auth profile)

### BE provides

Auth sessions:
- GET /v1/auth/sessions (list devices)
- DELETE /v1/auth/sessions (revoke all)
- DELETE /v1/auth/sessions/{deviceId} (revoke one device)

Auth profile:
- PATCH /v1/auth/avatar (update avatar tied to auth profile)

User profile:
- GET /v1/users/me/profile (current user profile + privacy)
- PATCH /v1/users/me/profile (update current user profile)
- PATCH /v1/users/me/privacy (update privacy)

Device/session headers used at login/register:
- x-device-id
- x-device-type
- x-device-platform
- x-display-label
- x-device-location
- user-agent

Socket:
- session:revoked event in root namespace

### FE needs to do

- Login/register: send device headers so backend can track sessions per device.
- Build a "Login devices" section in profile:
  - List sessions from GET /v1/auth/sessions.
  - Provide "Log out this device" and "Log out all".
- Listen for session:revoked; if current device revoked, force logout.
- Profile screen:
  - Load /v1/users/me/profile.
  - Allow editing displayName, avatar, bio, etc. per API schema.
  - Allow privacy settings via PATCH /v1/users/me/privacy.

### UI suggestion

- Device list row: icon + display label + location + last active time + "Revoke".
- Show "This device" badge for current deviceId.

## 4) Friend management (add, delete, block)

### BE provides

REST (add/delete):
- GET /v1/friendships (list friends)
- DELETE /v1/friendships/{friendId} (unfriend)
- GET /v1/friendships/search (search friends)
- GET /v1/friend-requests/received
- GET /v1/friend-requests/sent
- POST /v1/friend-requests/{receiverId} (send request)
- PATCH /v1/friend-requests/{requestId} (accept)
- DELETE /v1/friend-requests/{requestId} (reject/cancel)
- GET /v1/friend-requests/check/{targetUserId} (check status)
- GET /v1/friendships/count
- GET /v1/users/{id}/mutual-friends
- GET /v1/friends/suggestions

REST (block):
- POST /v1/blocks/{blockedUserId} (block)
- DELETE /v1/blocks/{blockedUserId} (unblock)
- GET /v1/blocks (list blocked)
- GET /v1/blocks/cursor (list blocked with cursor)
- GET /v1/blocks/{blockedUserId}/check (check block status)

Socket (/friends namespace):
- friend_request:received
- friend_request:accepted
- friend_request:rejected
- friend_request:canceled
- friendship:unfriended
- block:detected (notify if block affects relationships)

Socket (/blocks namespace):
- block:blocked
- block:unblocked

### FE needs to do

- Implement 3 tabs: Friends, Requests (Received/Sent), Suggestions.
- Add Blocked list in settings or privacy area.
- Use REST for list and actions; keep counts in sync.
- Connect to /friends and /blocks sockets and update UI in real time.
- When blocked: remove or hide conversations, disable message/send/friend actions.
- When unblocked: allow re-add and restore UI actions.

### UI suggestion

- Requests: card with avatar + name + Accept/Reject.
- Suggestions: quick Add button, plus mutual friends count.
- Blocked list: compact rows with Unblock action and a short privacy note.

## 5) Delete conversation

### BE provides

REST:
- DELETE /v1/conversations/{conversationId}

Notes:
- Delete is per user and stored as deletedAt (history cutoff).
- Messages after deletedAt remain accessible when they are new.

Socket:
- No dedicated delete conversation socket event; rely on REST and refresh list.

### FE needs to do

- Add "Delete conversation" in conversation options.
- Call DELETE /v1/conversations/{conversationId}.
- Remove conversation from list locally; clear messages cache for that conversation.
- If user opens same conversation again, reload from server.

### UI suggestion

- Confirm dialog: "Delete only removes for you".
- Offer "Archive" or "Hide" as softer alternatives if needed.

## 6) Implementation checklist (summary)

- Socket connections:
  - Root: presence + session revoke
  - /messages: typing and chat events
  - /friends: friend request notifications
  - /blocks: block/unblock notifications
- Presence:
  - Use getBatchOnlineStatus for lists
  - Listen for user:online/user:offline
- Typing:
  - Emit typing:start/typing:stop with debounce
  - Show typing indicator only for active conversation
- Device management:
  - Use /v1/auth/sessions endpoints
  - Display current device and revoke actions
- Friend management:
  - Add/delete via friend requests + unfriend
  - Block/unblock via /v1/blocks and /blocks socket
- Delete conversation:
  - Call DELETE /v1/conversations/{id}
  - Update conversation list and local caches

---

## 7) Design direction (quick ideas)

- Layout: a two-column chat list + conversation panel; profile and friends in a separate left-side tab.
- Presence: keep online dots small (6-8px) and consistent across list + profile.
- Typing: use subtle animated ellipsis bubble, avoid oversized banners.
- Device list: emphasize safety with a clear "Sign out other devices" action.
- Friends: separate "Requests" into Received/Sent; keep top CTA for "Find friends".
